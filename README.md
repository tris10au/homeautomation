# homeautomation

This is an extremely lightweight and simple task-based home automator. At current, it is used for managing solar export through inverter control. It uses the `openpower` library for all inverter/pricing data, and logs this data to a basic SQL database (to allow for potential reporting/analytics at a later date).
